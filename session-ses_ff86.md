## User

existe alguma forma no opencode de dar "sim" pra tudo? nao monitorado?

## Assistant (Build · DeepSeek V4 Flash Free · 21.7s)

_Thinking:_

The user is asking (in Portuguese) whether there's a way in opencode to just say "yes" to everything, unattended/automated. This is a question about opencode itself.

According to the instructions: "When the user directly asks about opencode (eg 'can opencode do...', 'does opencode have...') or asks in second person (eg 'are you able...', 'can you do...'), first use the WebFetch tool to gather information to answer the question from opencode docs at https://opencode.ai"

Also, there's a skill that might apply: "customize-opencode" - "Use ONLY when the user is editing or creating opencode's own configuration: opencode.json... Also use when creating or fixing opencode agents, subagents, skills, plugins, MCP servers, or permission rules."

The user is asking about auto-approving permissions in opencode. This relates to permission rules in opencode.json. The question is about how to make opencode auto-approve everything (permissions). This is a question about opencode config.

Let me consider skills. The question is "is there a way in opencode to say yes to everything? unattended?" This is asking about permission configuration. The customize-opencode skill is for editing opencode's own configuration. But the user is just asking a question, not necessarily editing config yet. However, if I'm going to answer about how to configure permissions, I should probably consult the opencode docs.

Per the system prompt: "When the user directly asks about opencode... first use the WebFetch tool to gather information to answer the question from opencode docs at https://opencode.ai"

So I should fetch opencode docs about permissions. Let me search the docs.

Also consider the superpowers skill that's loaded — "If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill."

The customize-opencode skill applies to editing opencode config. But the user is asking a question about whether there's a way. Answering requires knowledge of opencode config. Let me use the customize-opencode skill since the answer involves opencode's permission configuration, and possibly we'd create/edit config. But first, let me gather info from docs.

Actually, let me think. The question is a simple question. Per superpowers, questions are tasks and I should check skills. The relevant skill is "customize-opencode" for opencode config questions. Let me load it to be safe, and also fetch docs.

Actually the customize-opencode skill says: "Use ONLY when the user is editing or creating opencode's own configuration: opencode.json, opencode.jsonc, files under .opencode/, or files under ~/.config/opencode/. Also use when creating or fixing opencode agents, subagents, skills, plugins, MCP servers, or permission rules."

"permission rules" — yes, this is about permission rules. The user wants to know how to auto-approve. So this qualifies. Let me load the skill and also fetch the docs.

Let me do both in parallel: load the skill and fetch docs.

The opencode docs on permissions: https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/ likely. Let me fetch that.

Let me announce using the skill first.

Vou usar a skill **customize-opencode** (configuração de permissões do opencode) e consultar a documentação oficial.

**Tool: skill**

**Input:**
```json
{
  "name": "customize-opencode"
}
```

**Output:**
```
<skill_content name="customize-opencode">
# Skill: customize-opencode

<!--
  Built-in skill. Name and description are registered in code at
  packages/core/src/plugin/skill.ts
  and CUSTOMIZE_OPENCODE_SKILL_DESCRIPTION). The body below becomes the
  skill's content.
-->

# Customizing opencode

opencode validates its own config strictly and refuses to start when a field
is wrong. The shapes below cover the common surface area, but they are a
**summary, not the source of truth**.

## Full schema reference

The authoritative list of every config option — with field types, enums,
defaults, and descriptions — lives in the published JSON Schema:

**<https://opencode.ai/config.json>**

If a field is not documented in this skill, or you need to confirm an exact
shape before writing config, **fetch that URL and read the schema directly**
rather than guessing. opencode hard-fails on invalid config, so the cost of a
wrong shape is a broken startup.

Independently, every `opencode.json` should declare
`"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json"` so the user's editor catches
mistakes as they type.

## Applying changes

Config is loaded once when opencode starts and is not hot-reloaded. After
saving changes to `opencode.json`, an agent file, a skill, a plugin, or any
other config-time file, **tell the user to quit and restart opencode** for
the changes to take effect. The running session will keep using the
already-loaded config until then.

## Where files live

| Scope                         | Path                                                                                                                      |

Configs from each scope are deep-merged. Project overrides global. Unknown
top-level keys in `opencode.json` are rejected with `ConfigInvalidError`.

## opencode.json

Every field is optional.

Shape notes worth being explicit about:

- `model` always carries a provider prefix: `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"`.
- `skills` is an object with `paths` and/or `urls`, not an array.
- `references` is an object keyed by alias. Each value is a local path, Git repository, or string shorthand.
- `agent` is an object keyed by agent name, not an array.
- `command` is an object keyed by command name, not an array.
- `plugin` is an array of strings or `[name, options]` tuples, not an object.
- `mcp[name].command` is an array of strings, never a single string. `type` is required.
- `permission` is either a string action or an object keyed by tool name.

## Skills

opencode's skill loader scans for `**/SKILL.md` inside skill directories. The
file is named `SKILL.md` exactly, and lives in its own folder named after the
skill:

```
.opencode/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

Frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: One sentence covering what this skill does AND when to trigger it. Front-load the literal keywords or filenames the user is likely to say.
---

# My Skill

(skill body in markdown: instructions, examples, references)
```

- `name` is required, lowercase hyphen-separated, up to 64 chars, and matches the folder name.
- `description` is effectively required: skills without one are filtered out and never surfaced to the model. Cover both _what_ the skill does and _when_ to use it. Write in third person ("Use when...", not "I help with..."). Front-load concrete trigger keywords and filenames; gate with "Use ONLY when..." if the skill should stay quiet on adjacent topics.
- Optional: `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata` (string-string map).

Register skills from non-default locations via `skills.paths` (scanned
recursively for `**/SKILL.md`) and `skills.urls` (each URL serves a list of
skills).

## References

References make local directories and Git repositories outside the active
project available as supporting context. Configure them under `references`,
keyed by the alias used in `@` autocomplete:

```json
{
  "references": {
    "docs": {
      "path": "../product-docs",
      "description": "Use for product behavior and terminology"
    },
    "effect": {
      "repository": "Effect-TS/effect",
      "branch": "main",
      "description": "Use for Effect implementation details"
    }
  }
}
```

Local `path` values may be relative to the declaring config, absolute, or use
`~/`. Git `repository` values accept Git URLs, host/path references, and GitHub
`owner/repo` shorthand; `branch` is optional. Both forms support optional
`description` and `hidden` fields.

- Only references with a `description` are advertised to agents in system context.
- `hidden: true` removes a reference from TUI `@` autocomplete only. It remains available to agents and by direct path.
- Reference directories are automatically allowed through the external-directory boundary; normal read/edit/tool permissions still apply.
- String shorthand is supported: use `"docs": "../docs"` for local paths or `"effect": "Effect-TS/effect"` for Git repositories.

## Agents

Two ways to define an agent. Use the file form for anything non-trivial.

### Inline (in `opencode.json`)

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "my-reviewer": {
      "description": "Reviews PRs for style violations.",
      "mode": "subagent",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "permission": { "edit": "deny", "bash": "ask" },
      "prompt": "You are a strict PR reviewer..."
    }
  }
}
```

### File

```
.opencode/agent/my-reviewer.md      OR     .opencode/agents/my-reviewer.md
```

```markdown
---
description: Reviews PRs for style violations.
mode: subagent
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
permission:
  edit: deny
  bash: ask
---

You are a strict PR reviewer. Focus on...
```

The file body becomes the agent's `prompt`. Do not also put `prompt:` in the
frontmatter.

`mode` is one of `"primary"`, `"subagent"`, `"all"`.

Allowed top-level frontmatter fields: `name, model, variant, description, mode,
hidden, color, steps, options, permission, disable, temperature, top_p`. Any
unknown field is silently routed into `options`.

To disable a built-in agent: `agent: { build: { disable: true } }`, or in a
file, `disable: true` in frontmatter.

`default_agent` must point to a non-hidden, primary-mode agent.

### Built-in agents

opencode ships with `build`, `plan`, `general`, `explore`. Hidden internal agents:
`compaction`, `title`, `summary`. To override a built-in's fields, define the
same key in `agent: { <name>: { ... } }`.

## Commands

opencode's command loader scans for `**/*.md` inside command directories. The
file is named after the command, and lives directly inside the `command` folder:

```
.opencode/command/deploy.md
```

Frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: One sentence describing what the command does.
agent: build
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
---

(command body in markdown: the prompt opencode runs, with $ARGUMENTS for the user's input)
```

- `template` is the command body — everything below the frontmatter — and is required: it is the prompt opencode runs when the command is invoked. Do not also put a `template:` key in the frontmatter.
- `$ARGUMENTS` is replaced with everything the user typed after the command; `$1`, `$2`, … pull individual positional arguments.
- Optional: `description`, `agent`, `model`, `variant`, `subtask`.

## Plugins

`plugin:` is an array. Each entry is one of:

```json
"plugin": [
  "opencode-gemini-auth",            // npm spec, latest
  "opencode-foo@1.2.3",              // npm spec, pinned
  "./local-plugin.ts",               // file path, relative to the declaring config
  "file:///abs/path/plugin.js",      // file URL
  ["opencode-bar", { "key": "val" }] // tuple form with options
]
```

Auto-discovered plugins (no config entry needed): any `*.ts` or `*.js` file in
`.opencode/plugin/` or `.opencode/plugins/`.

A plugin module exports `default` (or any named export) of type
`Plugin = (input: PluginInput, options?) => Promise<Hooks>`. The export is a
function, not a plain object literal, and the function returns an object
(return `{}` if there is nothing to register).

```ts
import type { Plugin } from "@opencode-ai/plugin"

export default (async ({ client, project, directory, $ }) => {
  return {
    config: (cfg) => {
      // cfg is the live merged config; mutate fields here.
    },
    "tool.execute.before": async (input, output) => {
      // mutate output.args before the tool runs
    },
  }
}) satisfies Plugin
```

Hook surface (mutate `output` in place; return `void`):

- `event(input)`: every bus event
- `config(cfg)`: once on init with the merged config
- `chat.message`, `chat.params`, `chat.headers`
- `tool.execute.before`, `tool.execute.after`
- `tool.definition`
- `command.execute.before`
- `shell.env`
- `permission.ask`
- `experimental.chat.messages.transform`, `experimental.chat.system.transform`,
  `experimental.session.compacting`, `experimental.compaction.autocontinue`,
  `experimental.text.complete`

Special object-shaped (not callbacks): `tool: { my_tool: { ... } }`,
`auth: { ... }`, `provider: { ... }`.

## MCP servers

`mcp:` is an object keyed by server name. Each server is discriminated by
`type`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "playwright": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "@playwright/mcp"],
      "enabled": true,
      "environment": { "BROWSER": "chromium" }
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://...",
      "enabled": true,
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer {env:GITHUB_TOKEN}" }
    },
    "old-server": { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

`command` is an array of strings. `environment` sets environment variables for
a local MCP server. `type` is required. Use `enabled: false` to
disable a server inherited from a parent config. String values such as header
tokens support `{env:VAR}` interpolation (and `{file:path}`); the shell-style
`${VAR}` is not substituted.

## Permissions

```json
"permission": {
  "edit": "deny",
  "bash": { "git *": "allow", "rm *": "deny", "*": "ask" },
  "external_directory": { "~/secrets/**": "deny", "*": "allow" }
}
```

Actions: `"allow"`, `"ask"`, `"deny"`.

Per-tool value forms: `"allow"` shorthand (treated as `{"*": "allow"}`), or an
object `{ pattern: action }`. Within an object, **insertion order matters**.
opencode evaluates the LAST matching rule, so put broad rules first and narrow
rules last.

`permission: "allow"` (a string at the top level) is shorthand for "allow
everything" and is rarely what the user wants.

Known permission keys: `read, edit, glob, grep, list, bash, task,
external_directory, todowrite, question, webfetch, websearch, lsp, doom_loop,
skill`. Some of these (`todowrite,
question, webfetch, websearch, doom_loop`) only accept a flat
action, not a per-pattern object.

`external_directory` patterns are filesystem paths (use `~/`, absolute paths,
or globs like `~/projects/**`).

Per-agent `permission:` overrides top-level `permission:`. Plan Mode lives on
the `plan` agent's permission ruleset (`edit: deny *`).

## Escape hatches

When a user's config is broken and opencode won't start, these env vars help:

- `OPENCODE_DISABLE_PROJECT_CONFIG=1`: skip the project's local `opencode.json`
  and start from globals only. Run from the project directory, opencode loads,
  the user edits the broken file, then they restart without the flag.
- `OPENCODE_CONFIG=/path/to/file.json`: load an additional explicit config.
- `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT='{"$schema":"https://opencode.ai/config.json"}'`:
  inject inline JSON as a final local-scope merge.
- `OPENCODE_DISABLE_DEFAULT_PLUGINS=1`: skip default plugins.
- `OPENCODE_PURE=1`: skip external plugins entirely.
- `OPENCODE_DISABLE_EXTERNAL_SKILLS=1`,
  `OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_SKILLS=1`: skip the external skill scans under
  `~/.claude/` and `~/.agents/`.

## When proposing edits

- Validate against the schema before writing. If you are unsure of a field's
  exact shape, or the field is not covered in this skill, fetch
  `https://opencode.ai/config.json` and read the schema rather than guessing.
- Preserve `$schema` and any existing fields the user did not ask to change.
- For agent, command, skill, and plugin definitions, prefer creating new files
  in the correct location over inlining everything in `opencode.json`.
- If the user's existing config is malformed, point them at the env-var escape
  hatches above so they can edit from inside opencode without breaking their
  session.
- After saving any config change, remind the user to quit and restart opencode
  — running sessions keep using the already-loaded config.

# Permissions

Control which actions require approval to run.

OpenCode uses the `permission` config to decide whether a given action should run automatically, prompt you, or be blocked.

As of `v1.1.1`, the legacy `tools` boolean config is deprecated and has been merged into `permission`. The old `tools` config is still supported for backwards compatibility.

---

## [Actions](#actions)

Each permission rule resolves to one of:

-   `"allow"` — run without approval
-   `"ask"` — prompt for approval
-   `"deny"` — block the action

---

## [Auto mode](#auto-mode)

Start OpenCode with `--auto` to automatically approve permission requests that are not explicitly denied.

Terminal window

```
opencode --auto
```

You can also use auto mode with [`opencode run`](/docs/cli#run).

Terminal window

```
opencode run --auto "Refactor this module"
```

Explicit `"deny"` rules are still enforced. Auto mode only changes requests that would otherwise ask for approval.

In the TUI, open the command palette and select **Enable auto-approve permissions** or **Disable auto-approve permissions** to change modes. When auto mode is active, the prompt displays a muted `auto` indicator next to the current agent.

---

## [Configuration](#configuration)

You can set permissions globally (with `*`), and override specific tools.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "permission": {    "*": "ask",    "bash": "allow",    "edit": "deny"  }}
```

You can also set all permissions at once:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "permission": "allow"}
```

---

## [Granular Rules (Object Syntax)](#granular-rules-object-syntax)

For most permissions, you can use an object to apply different actions based on the tool input.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "permission": {    "bash": {      "*": "ask",      "git *": "allow",      "npm *": "allow",      "rm *": "deny",      "grep *": "allow"    },    "edit": {      "*": "deny",      "packages/web/src/content/docs/*.mdx": "allow"    }  }}
```

Rules are evaluated by pattern match, with the **last matching rule winning**. A common pattern is to put the catch-all `"*"` rule first, and more specific rules after it.

### [Wildcards](#wildcards)

Permission patterns use simple wildcard matching:

-   `*` matches zero or more of any character
-   `?` matches exactly one character
-   All other characters match literally

### [Home Directory Expansion](#home-directory-expansion)

You can use `~` or `$HOME` at the start of a pattern to reference your home directory. This is particularly useful for [`external_directory`](#external-directories) rules.

-   `~/projects/*` -> `/Users/username/projects/*`
-   `$HOME/projects/*` -> `/Users/username/projects/*`
-   `~` -> `/Users/username`

### [External Directories](#external-directories)

Use `external_directory` to allow tool calls that touch paths outside the working directory where OpenCode was started. This applies to any tool that takes a path as input (for example `read`, `edit`, `glob`, `grep`, and many `bash` commands).

Home expansion (like `~/...`) only affects how a pattern is written. It does not make an external path part of the current workspace, so paths outside the working directory must still be allowed via `external_directory`.

For example, this allows access to everything under `~/projects/personal/`:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "permission": {    "external_directory": {      "~/projects/personal/**": "allow"    }  }}
```

Any directory allowed here inherits the same defaults as the current workspace. Since [`read` defaults to `allow`](#defaults), reads are also allowed for entries under `external_directory` unless overridden. Add explicit rules when a tool should be restricted in these paths, such as blocking edits while keeping reads:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "permission": {    "external_directory": {      "~/projects/personal/**": "allow"    },    "edit": {      "~/projects/personal/**": "deny"    }  }}
```

Keep the list focused on trusted paths, and layer extra allow or deny rules as needed for other tools (for example `bash`).

---

## [Available Permissions](#available-permissions)

OpenCode permissions are keyed by tool name, plus a couple of safety guards:

-   `read` — reading a file (matches the file path)
-   `edit` — all file modifications (covers `edit`, `write`, `patch`)
-   `glob` — file globbing (matches the glob pattern)
-   `grep` — content search (matches the regex pattern)
-   `bash` — running shell commands (matches parsed commands like `git status --porcelain`)
-   `task` — launching subagents (matches the subagent type)
-   `skill` — loading a skill (matches the skill name)
-   `lsp` — running LSP queries (currently non-granular)
-   `question` — asking the user questions during execution
-   `webfetch` — fetching a URL (matches the URL)
-   `websearch` — web search (matches the query)
-   `external_directory` — triggered when a tool touches paths outside the project working directory
-   `doom_loop` — triggered when the same tool call repeats 3 times with identical input

---

## [Defaults](#defaults)

If you don’t specify anything, OpenCode starts from permissive defaults:

-   Most permissions default to `"allow"`.
-   `doom_loop` and `external_directory` default to `"ask"`.
-   `read` is `"allow"`, but `.env` files are denied by default:

opencode.json

```
{  "permission": {    "read": {      "*": "allow",      "*.env": "deny",      "*.env.*": "deny",      "*.env.example": "allow"    }  }}
```

---

## [What “Ask” Does](#what-ask-does)

When OpenCode prompts for approval, the UI offers three outcomes:

-   `once` — approve just this request
-   `always` — approve future requests matching the suggested patterns (for the rest of the current OpenCode session)
-   `reject` — deny the request

The set of patterns that `always` would approve is provided by the tool (for example, bash approvals typically whitelist a safe command prefix like `git status*`).

---

## [Agents](#agents)

You can override permissions per agent. Agent permissions are merged with the global config, and agent rules take precedence. [Learn more](/docs/agents#permissions) about agent permissions.

Note

Refer to the [Granular Rules (Object Syntax)](#granular-rules-object-syntax) section above for more detailed pattern matching examples.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "permission": {    "bash": {      "*": "ask",      "git *": "allow",      "git commit *": "deny",      "git push *": "deny",      "grep *": "allow"    }  },  "agent": {    "build": {      "permission": {        "bash": {          "*": "ask",          "git *": "allow",          "git commit *": "ask",          "git push *": "deny",          "grep *": "allow"        }      }    }  }}
```

You can also configure agent permissions in Markdown:

~/.config/opencode/agents/review.md

```
---description: Code review without editsmode: subagentpermission:  edit: deny  bash: ask  webfetch: deny---
Only analyze code and suggest changes.
```

Tip

Use pattern matching for commands with arguments. `"grep *"` allows `grep pattern file.txt`, while `"grep"` alone would block it. Commands like `git status` work for default behavior but require explicit permission (like `"git status *"`) when arguments are passed.

_Thinking:_

The user asks in Portuguese: "existe alguma forma no opencode de dar 'sim' pra tudo? nao monitorado?" = "is there a way in opencode to say 'yes' to everything? unattended/without monitoring?"

Answer: Yes. Two ways:
1. `opencode --auto` flag - auto-approves all permission requests that aren't explicitly denied. Also works with `opencode run --auto`.
2. Config: `"permission": "allow"` in opencode.json (allows everything, but note explicit "deny" rules still enforced — actually with config allow, everything is allow unless deny). Wait, `permission: "allow"` is shorthand for allow everything. But deny rules still enforced.
3. In TUI, command palette → Enable auto-approve permissions.

Also there's Zen mode? Let me think - there's `opencode zen`? Actually the docs mention Zen in Usage. Zen mode is a privacy/encrypted mode, not auto-approve. The user might confuse it. But there's also `--tier` in assistente-os. Not relevant.

So the direct answer: yes — use `opencode --auto`, or config `"permission": "allow"`, or TUI palette toggle.

The user is on Windows, using assistente-os which runs `opencode run` headless on souls. The `--auto` flag with `opencode run` is directly relevant. Also the assistente-os action_execute has tier parameter (local/zen/soul) - "zen" refers to opencode zen mode perhaps. But the question is general about opencode.

Let me answer concisely in Portuguese. Keep it short. This is a question, not a task requiring config edits. Answer directly.

Answer: Yes.
- `opencode --auto` (or `opencode run --auto`) — auto-aprova tudo que não está explicitamente negado.
- No TUI: paleta de comandos → Enable auto-approve permissions.
- Config: `"permission": "allow"` no opencode.json.
- Deny rules still enforced. Not truly "unmonitored" in the sense that denies still apply, but nothing asks.

Keep under 4 lines-ish. I'll be concise.

Sim, duas formas:

- **Flag `--auto`**: `opencode --auto` (ou `opencode run --auto "tarefa"`) auto-aprova tudo que não estiver explicitamente com `"deny"`.
- **Config**: no `opencode.json`, `"permission": "allow"` (allow pra tudo, negar regras explícitas ainda valem). No TUI, dá pra alternar pela paleta de comandos em **Enable auto-approve permissions**.

Não é 100% "não monitorado" — regras `deny` continuam bloqueando — mas nada pedirá confirmação.

_Thinking:_

The user wants to set `"permission": "allow"` in the opencode config. I need to find the existing config file. The skill mentioned the project config is `./opencode.json`, `./opencode.jsonc`, or `.opencode/opencode.json`. There's an `opencode.json` in the workspace root (D:\Projetos\assistente-os\opencode.json was listed in skill_files).

Let me read it first.

**Tool: read**

**Input:**
```json
{
  "filePath": "D:\\Projetos\\assistente-os\\opencode.json"
}
```

**Output:**
```
<path>D:\Projetos\assistente-os\opencode.json</path>
<type>file</type>
